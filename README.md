RunLang is a **fast, lightweight scripting language** for quick execution and compilation.  
It is a **superset of the Go (Golang) programming language**, designed for simplicity, speed, and memory efficiency.  

RunLang allows you to **import and export packages**, delete unused functions for memory optimization, and even use the **Love2D framework** inside Go.
